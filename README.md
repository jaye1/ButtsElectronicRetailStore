Problem Statement: Electronic Retail Store
The new electronic retailer chain, EMQ, wants to add delivery services to their business plans in the Bay Area counties. Information for population density and a map will help in strategically determining where to open their two stores in each county. This information will also ensure for speedy deliveries. 
A website will be made to allow for online purchases of electronic devices. Items will be added into a virtual shopping cart and payments will be also be made through the website. After a purchase is made, a confirmation will be sent to the customer, and they will be provided with tracking info once their product is being shipped to them. The delivery will be tracked via Google map. 
A database management system will be used to process and store data on inventory, customer transactions, and tracking to corresponding customer transactions.
